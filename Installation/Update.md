`Note: before each update, it is recommended to make a backup of the data as well as to test first on a development infrastructure in order to validate the integrity of the data.`

**WARNING : it is not possible to migrate GLPI 10 to ITSM-NG.**

## Update or migrate

Download the latest version of ITSM-NG at the following link : [https://github.com/itsmng/itsm-ng/releases](https://github.com/itsmng/itsm-ng/releases)

Uncompress the release in the same directory as the currently installed version.

There are two ways to update ITSM-NG or to migrate from GLPI :

* [Update from web](#update-from-web)
* [Update from command line](#update-from-command-line)

## Update from web

First step, copy the `config_db.php` and `glpicrypt.key` files present in the old folder `itsm-ng/config` or `glpi/config` in the new folder `itsm-ng/config`.

Then, go to your ITSM-NG or GLPI url.

If the requirements are OK, click on `Upgrade`.

![Update database](/update/update_database.png)

Click on `Use ITSM-NG` then log in with your usual credentials. 

## Update from command line

First step, copy the `config_db.php` and `glpicrypt.key` files present in the old folder `itsm-ng/config` or `glpi/config` in the new folder `itsm-ng/config`.

Then, run the following command :

    php bin/console itsmng:database:update
